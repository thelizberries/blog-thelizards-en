## The inspiration during the tribute tour to The Cranberries

The Strange Dream video was born on the road, during

the tribute tour to The Cranberries, in the summer of 2025, in a land that could only be its natural cradle: Ireland.

## A journey between cliffs and uncontaminated spaces
For ten days we crossed some of the wildest and most evocative places on the island. From Northern Ireland to the harshest coasts of the West, passing through the Aran Islands, Connemara and the most pristine areas near the Giant's Causeway.

## A milestone: nature
Each stop was a continuous search for powerful atmospheres full of magic: the famous tree-lined avenue made famous by Game of Thrones, a very white beach where the sand "sings" under your feet, windswept cliffs and silences that seem to speak.
Not to mention how powerful it was to travel back to the places that inspired the songs of Dolores O'Riordan and her band, The Cranberries.

## The backstage: for the right shots the equipment has its weight😅
Filming the music video for “Strange Dream” was a real adventure. The videomaker Alessandro Linotna never separated from his backpack... very heavy, full of equipment, which accompanied him everywhere, path after path, so as not to miss a single shot.

## Cristina's luggage: elf disguise🍀
Cristina, on the other hand, traveled with a decidedly more "fairytale" bag: inside there was always her elven sweater, ready for filming, and - inevitable - her elf ears, always at hand. Imagine the scene if someone had opened that backpack for a check... what would they have thought?😄

## Drone filming: a look from above
Alessandro's drone shots deserve a separate chapter and are simply spectacular. In particular, the Waterfall viewpoint, in the far north of Northern Ireland, provided unforgettable emotions. The lake you can see from above was a surprise for us too: we didn't even know it existed, hidden up there, at the top of the mountain.

## A return full of tension
The return of the drone, however, was not without tension: it had gone very far and above all too high. For a moment we feared losing him. But, faithful and determined, he managed to go back, giving us those breathtaking shots that today tell Ireland from above, in all its power and beauty.

## Strange Dream as a travel experience
Strange Dream is not just a video: it is a journey, a tribute, a dream lived step by step, immersed in a land that can be harsh, mystical and deeply inspiring.🍀✨
