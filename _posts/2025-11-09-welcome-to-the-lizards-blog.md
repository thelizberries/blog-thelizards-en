Hi everyone! 

We are The Lizards a group that has decided to open this little online space to share with you what we are passionate about.

Here you will find:
-  behind the scenes of our projects
-  stories, thoughts and inspirations
-  photos and moments that don't end up on Instagram
-  ideas, advice and some surprises

For us this blog is like an open diary: a place where we can talk about ourselves without filters and where you can leave comments, questions or even just a greeting.

If you're curious to find out what's cooking, stay with us: we will soon publish the first update.

Thanks for being here 
The Lizards
