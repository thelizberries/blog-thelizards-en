Hi everyone!👋

We are The Lizards – a group of [band/creatives/friends] who have decided to open this little online space to share with you what we are passionate about.

Here you will find:
- 🎶 behind the scenes of our projects
- 📝 stories, thoughts and inspirations
- 📸 photos and moments that never end up on Instagram
- 💡 ideas, advice and some surprises

For us this blog is like an open diary: a place where we can talk about ourselves without filters and where you can leave comments, questions or even just a greeting.

If you're curious to find out what's cooking, stay with us: we will soon publish the first update on [a project/a song/something of yours].

Thanks for being here 💜
The Lizards
