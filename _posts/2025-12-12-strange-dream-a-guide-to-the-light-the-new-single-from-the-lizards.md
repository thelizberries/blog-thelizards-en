## The Lizards and their “Strange Dream”

“Dreams are desires”, someone sang some time ago in a famous cartoon.

And sometimes it is precisely an unusual dream - a "Strange Dream" - that delicately shows us the direction towards which our soul tends.

What am I talking about?Of The Lizards' new single.


## The song
Imagination becomes an opening, a suspended place in which to be guided.
The Lizards create a “strange” atmosphere.They envelop the listener in a persuasive and profoundly dreamlike aura.


## The journey
The vision takes shape through a fantasy language, where an elf becomes a mentor and companion in this adventure.

It is she who leads beyond the forest paths, among the silent ruins of an ancient cathedral and then into a cave.

Finally, thanks to a magical pendant, to an enchanted place that smells of rebirth.

The landscapes of Ireland - wild, poetic, imbued with natural magic - are the setting for this internal process of transformation.


## The meaning
Strange Dream invites us to leave the night behind.

It encourages us to welcome the light, to listen to that deep part of us that asks for change.

Sometimes, in fact, the unconscious is the first to speak: it whispers the need to evolve, to dissolve the shadows of the past, to rediscover one's path.


## Two voices, one path

With “Strange Dream”, The Lizards choose to inspire this path.
By putting their two voices – male and female – into dialogue, which become a guide, compass, presence.

They remind us that, if we have the courage to continue walking, destiny can lead us towards landscapes of light, uncontaminated nature and authentic inner peace.
